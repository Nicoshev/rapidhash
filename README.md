rapidhash - Very fast, high quality, platform-independent
====

The fastest recommended hash function by [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher?tab=readme-ov-file#summary).

The fastest passing hash in [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/README.md#passing-hashes).

rapidhash is [wyhash](https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash)' official successor, with improved speed, quality and compatibility.

**Fast**  
Extremely fast for both short and large inputs.  
Surpasses [70GB/s](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#outstanding-performance) on Apple's M4 cpus.  
The fastest hash function passing all tests in [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher?tab=readme-ov-file#smhasher).  
The fastest hash function passing all tests in [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/README.md#passing-hashes).

**Universal**  
Optimized for both AMD64 and AArch64 systems.  
Compatible with gcc, clang, icx and MSVC.  
It does not use machine-specific vectorized or cryptographic instruction sets.  
Prepared for both C and C++ compilation.

**Excellent**  
Passes all tests in both [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/rapidhash.txt) and [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/raw/rapidhash.txt).  
[Collision-based study](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#collision-based-hash-quality-study) showed a collision probability lower than wyhash and close to ideal.  
Outstanding collision ratio when tested with datasets of 16B and 66B keys:

Collision-based hash quality study
-------------------------

A perfect hash function distributes its domain uniformly onto the image.  
When the domain's cardinality is a multiple of the image's cardinality, each potential output has the same probability of being produced.  
A function producing 64-bit hashes should have a $p=1/2^{64}$ of generating each output.  

If we compute $n$ hashes, the expected amount of collisions should be the number of unique input pairs times the probability of producing a given hash.  
This should be $(n*(n-1))/2 * 1/2^{64}$, or simplified: $(n*(n-1))/2^{65}$.  
In the case of hashing $15*2^{30}$ (~16.1B) different keys, we should expect to see $7.03$ collisions.  

We present an experiment in which we use rapidhash to hash $77$ datasets of $15*2^{30}$ (15Gi) keys each.  
For each dataset, the amount of collisions produced is recorded as measurement.  
Ideally, the average among measurements should be $7.03$ and the results collection should be a binomial distribution.  
We obtained a mean value of $8.06$, just $14.65$% over $7.03$.  
Each dataset individual result and the collisions test program can be found in the [collisions folder](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master/collisions).  
The default seed $0$ was used in all experiments.
